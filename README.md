# Getting started

Folow these steps to get the chat application up and running.

## Step 1: Clone the repository

First, you will need to clone the repository.

After that you will need to install the needed dependecies for the application:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

After that, you will need to start the **Metro** server.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the project. Run the following command to start the _Android_ application:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the chat application running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
